## Course Structure & What You'll Learn

This course starts with the very basics of programming, assuming you have no prior experience. You will learn about variables, data types, loops, and conditional statements, all within the context of soccer. For instance, you might learn about variables by representing player statistics or about loops by simulating player movements.

The course then progresses to more advanced topics like object-oriented programming, where you'll learn to model soccer players, teams, and even the ball as objects with specific properties and behaviors.

Finally, you'll learn how to use your coding skills to build simulations, analyze game data, and even create your own simplified soccer game. Imagine simulating a match between two teams based on their historical performance data – that's the kind of project you'll be capable of after completing this course.
